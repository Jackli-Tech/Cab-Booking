2. Brief instructions on how to use the system.
This is basicly a simple booking system and you can go to booking page to input your information. After you click Search button, we can show those “unassigned” booking requests
with a pick-up time within 2 hours from now only on the admin page. Then we can click assign button at each end of row of booking requests to assign the taxi to each specific request.
